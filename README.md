# Hello World

I have begun with learning python and now i am learning c/c++, java, javascript, html, css and i think that is all right now. 

i have finally figured out what i want to do in life, and that is code computer programs or run test on software discovering exploits and then making patches to fix. I also have a interest in networking and ethical hacking.
